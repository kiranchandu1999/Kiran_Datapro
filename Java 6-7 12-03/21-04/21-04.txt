String:
It is a class in java which is used to store sequence of characters.
we can create strings in following ways:
1. using string literal
syntax:  String s1 = " ";
- these kind of string objects will be stored inside string constant pool which is present inside heap area.

2. using new keyword
syntax: String s2 = new String(" ");
- these kind of string objects will be stored in direct heap area not inside string constant pool.

methods:
1. charAt(index)   --->  to get character at given index.
2. length()     ---->  to get the string size;
3. startsWith(String)   ---> to check starting with given string



StringBuffer: (Synchronized)
StringBuffer is a class which is used in place of strings why because if we are trying to change or modify any string we can't. because strings are immutable (can't modify). so in that case we can use string buffer instead of string.

methods:
- setCharAt(index, char) ---> to set character at particular index.


StringBuilder: (Non Synchronized)
it is also same like string buffer class but it is non synchronized. works faster than string buffer.


StringJoiner:
it is a class which is used to join multiple strings with defined delimeter, prefix and suffix to get the final output.
syntax:
StringJoiner sj = new StringJoiner(delimeter, prefix, suffix);
sj.add("string1");
sj.add("string2");

"["java"]" + "python"   ----> "[java]python"   ( normal string exec)

"[java]" + "python"   ----> "[java, python]"   ( using string joiner)
