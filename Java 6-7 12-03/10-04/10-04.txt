3.Abstraction:
abstraction is a mechanism which is used for data hiding.
it hides the method implementation details and it shows only definition.
implementation ways:
i. abstract class
ii. interface

i. abstract class: (not 100% abstraction)
rules:
- a method implementation can be hidden by making method as abstract.
- if any abstract method presents in any class then that class also should be abstract.
- abstract methods implementation should be done in child class by method overrding.
- we can't create object for abstract classes.
- In abstract class we can have abstract and non abstract methods as well.


(ii). interface: (100% abstraction)
- interface is similar to class only.
- it is created by using interface keyword intead of class keyword
- we can't create objects for interfaces
- abstract methods implementation should be done in child class by method overriding.
- for method overriding in child class we need to use implements keyword instead of extends keyword for inheritance.
- by default methods in interface are public and abstract.
- by default variables are public, static and final.
