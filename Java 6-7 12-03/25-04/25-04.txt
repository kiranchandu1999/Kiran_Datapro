Lambda expression:
Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.
A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

syntax:
(parameter1, parameter2) -> { code block }


Nested classes:
When one class is declared inside another class then it is called nested class.

types:
1. static member class
   -- if inner class declared with static keyword then it's called static  member class.
ex:
class outer_class{
    // static member class
    static class  inner_class{
           // methods
    }

    // methods
}

2. non static member class (inner class)
   -- when we create non static class inside another class.
ex:
class outer_class{
    // non static member class
    class  inner_class{
           // methods
    }

    // methods
}

3. method local inner class
  - if any class presents inside a method then it's called local inner class.
ex:
class Outer{
    public void print(){
           class LocalClass{
                  // methods
            }

            // object creation
            // inner class methods execution
   }
}


4. anonymous inner class
- it is a class which doesn't have any name.
