MongoDB:
It is a language (NoSQL) and software to manage the database.
It is a non RDBMS, the data will be stored in the form of documents (JSON).

Terminologies:
- Database:
   It is memory space where data gets stored. One database can have       multiple collections.
- Collection:
   It is group of multiple records. Table refers the collection in SQL.
- Document:
   It is a object (JSON) where data will be stored in mongodb. Rows/    Records replicate this documents in SQL.
- Fields:
   It is a key in document data in mongodb database. Columns refer to fields    in SQL.

Features:
1. Schema-less database:
     it doesn't follows any pre-defined structure to store data. so it's easy to        manipulate individual documents.
2. High Scalability:
     In mongodb data will be shared across multiple servers so that      horizontal scalling is easy when amount of data gets increased on any           server.
3. Fast response:
     Query response is faster than sql database. because here no need to       join any tables to get final result.
4. Indexing:
     here we can create index on any field of one document so that searching      will be fast.

How to use MongoDB:
1. can use mongodb locally (need to install mongodb server)
2. can use cloud based mongodb (just create mongodb atlas account and connect to it).

Installation process:
- download MongoDB community server and set environment variable path
- check whether installed or not by using command -->  mongod --version
- to use CLI need to install mongodb shell
- after that just type mongosh in cmd for connecting to shell and start queries.
- for importing and exporting data (array of objects) we can install
