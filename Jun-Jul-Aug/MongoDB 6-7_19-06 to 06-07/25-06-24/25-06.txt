Complex expressions:
$expr:
  this operator is used to define complex expressions and based on that     exapression we will get data as output.

syntax:
  db.collection.find({$expr: {operator: [filed, value]}})
ex: 
   db.students.find({$expr: {$gt: ['$age', 21]}})
without $expr:
    db.students.find({age: {$gt: 21}})
real use case:
     db.students.find({$expr: {$gt: [ '$age', {$multiply: [4, 5]}]}})

Embedded documents:
if any document having a field with value as an array or an object then it's called embedded document. 
to access embedded documents need to use dot notation.
syntax: db.collection.find('parent.child': value)
