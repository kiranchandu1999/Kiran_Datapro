Cursor methods:
1. count() :
     it is used to display count of queried data.

2. limit(number) :
     it is used to limiting the diplaying data from query.

3. skip(number):
     this method is used to skip the starting documents.

4. sort(object{}):
     this method is used to diplay sorted data either ascending or      descending. object will take field name as key and 1 or -1 as value.
     note:  1 for ascending and -1 for descending.


Ordered and unordered insertion of data:
- basically inserting of documents by default follows insertion order.
- by default ordered key is true, so that while inserting multiple documents if any error occured then it stops insertion into db.
- so if we make ordered key value as false then it will ignores those error documents and inserts remaining ones.

syntax: db.collection.insertMany([{}, {}], {ordered: false});


Elements operators:
These operators are used to display data according to field properties like field existnace, field value size etc.
1. exists:
     - it is used to display data based particluar field existence.
     - it takes true or false, if we pass true in the query it will show data which       is having that field vice versa.
ex: db.students.find({city: {$exists: false}, ph: {$exists: true}});

2. type:
    - it is used to display data based on filed type like string, number etc.
    - it takes field type as a value for $type key.
ex: db.students.find({ph: {$type: 'string'}});

3. size:
    - it is used to display the data based on array size of a particular field.
ex: db.students.find({comments: {$size: 4});
