Multi dimensional array:
when an array contains multiple arrays in it then it is called multi-dimensional array.

syntax for 2D:
data_type[ ][ ]  variable_name  =  new  data_type[ rows ][ cols ];
ex:  4, 5, 8, 6
        1, 3, 7, 2
         9, 4, 5, 1
int[ ][ ]  arr1  =  new int[3][4];

// data read and write
arr1[1][2] ---> 7


for each loop / enhanced for loop:
syntax:
for(data_type  variable_name : array/set) {
      // loop body
}


Wrapper class:
It's a class which is built based on primitive data types. so that these classes are oftenly used with collection api (stack, queue, etc).
byte ---->   Byte
short --->   Short
int     ---->   Integer
long   --->   Long
float    --->  Float
double  ----> Double
char    ---->   Character
boolean   ---->  Boolean

boxing:  converting primitive to wrapper class object
ex: Interger a1 = Integer.valueOf(10);

un-boxing: converting wrapper class object to primitive
ex: int a2 = a1.intValue();

note:
we can do boxing and unboxing automatically. those are called as
auto-boxing and auto un-boxing
