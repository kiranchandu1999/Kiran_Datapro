Polymorphism:
- Basically polymorphism can be achieved in 2 ways,
1. Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
  -- multiple methods with same name within the class
  -- either no of parameters or data type should be different

2. Runtime polymorphism (Method Overriding)
  -- If we over write any method of parent class in child class then it is called       method overriding
  -- we can follow same signature of method inside parent class to override       in child class.

Super keyword:
it is used to refer the immediate parent object from child child class.
by using super() we can call parent class constructor
