OOPs:
1. Encapsulation
   - It is a process of encapsulating all variables and methods which are inter related within a block. and we call it as class.
  - we can restrict data accessibility for other classes and methods.

Access modifiers:
1. private
2. default
3. protected
4. public

2. Inheritance
 - Acquiring properties from parent class to child class.
 - by using extends keyword we can aquire properties of parent class
types of inheritance:
i. Single level inheritance
    --  from one parent to one child
ii. Multi level
    -- from grand_parent to parent, parent to child
iii. Heirarchical
    -- from one parent to multiple child classes
iv. Multiple (it is not possible by classes in java)
    -- from multiple parent classes to one child class

3. Polymorphism
  - it means many forms (related to methods)
  - we can have multiple methods with same names
- polymorphism can be achieved by following 2 ways:
  i. by passing different no of parameters
  ii. by passing different data types of parameters 

4. Abstraction
