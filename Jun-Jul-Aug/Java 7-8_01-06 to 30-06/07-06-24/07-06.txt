Loops:
for loop:
if we know the no of iterations then we can use this loop
syntax:
for(initialization; condition; updation){
     // loop body
}

while loop:
if we doesn't know the no of iterations the use this loop
syntax:
initialization
while(condition) {
     // while loop body
}

do while loop:
it is similar to while loop but it will execute first then checks the condition.
syntax:
do{
  // loop body
} while(condition);

continue statement:
it is used to skip current flow execution and forward to next iteration.
