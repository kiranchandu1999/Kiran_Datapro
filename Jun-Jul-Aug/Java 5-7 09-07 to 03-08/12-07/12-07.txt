this keyword:
- it refers to the current object itself
- it is used to call current object variables and methods as well.
- this() is used to call the constructor of current object.

static keyword:
- using static keyword we can make variables, methods as static.
- if any variable or method is static it is related to class not object related.
- to call static variable or method use class name instead of object name.

Four pillars of OOPs:
1. Inheritance
 - acquiring properties and methods from parent class to child class.
 - we need to use extends keyword with child class to acquire properties        from parent class

types:
i. Single level inheritance
  -- from one parent to one child

ii. Multi level
  -- from grand parent to parent and then parent to child and so on.

iii. Hierarchical inheritance
   -- from one parent class to multiple child classes

iv. Multiple inheritance (not possible by classes in java)
   -- from multiple parents to single child

2. Polymorphism
 - many methods with same name with different functionality.
 - we can achieve polymorphism by following ways
   i. by passing different no of parameters
   ii. by passing different data type paramters

types:
i. Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
  - overloading methods with same name within the class.

ii. Runtime polymorphism (Method overriding)
  - writing the method which is present in parent class into child class with same method signature then it is called method overriding

3. Abstraction
4. Encapsulation
