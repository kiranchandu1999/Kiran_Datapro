Object class:
The Object class, found in the java.lang package, serves as the root of the class hierarchy in Java. Every class in Java implicitly or explicitly inherits from the Object class.
Inherited methods from object class:
- toString(): Returns a string representation of the object.
- equals(Object obj): Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
- hashCode(): Returns a hash code value for the object.
- getClass(): Returns the runtime class of this Object.
- clone(): Creates and returns a copy of this object.
