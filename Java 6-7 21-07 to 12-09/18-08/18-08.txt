Object cloning:
Object cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of an existing object. In Java, this is achieved using the clone() method, which is part of the Object class.
To enable object closing class should implement "Cloneable" interface and must override "clone()" method.
Shallow copy: It copies only primitive fields.
Deep copy: It copies all primitive and non primitive fields
