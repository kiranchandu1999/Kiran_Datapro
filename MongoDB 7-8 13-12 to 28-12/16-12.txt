Database: It is a workspace where data get stored.

Communication with database:
GUI : Graphical User interface
CLI : Command Line Interface

Types of Database based on storage structure:

Relational Database (tables): SQL (Structured Query Language)

Non-relational database (objects): MongoDB


Software that is used to manage the database is called database management system (DBMS)

RDBMS : MySQL, MsSQL server, PostgreSQL

Non-RDBMS : MongoDB server


MongoDB:
It is a language (NoSQL) and software to manage the database.
It is a non RDBMS, will insert the data in the form of documents (JSON) and that data will be stored in (BSON).

JSON ex:
{
"name": "sai devisri",
"email": "asddfafdf",
"age": 20
}

Terminologies:
- Database:
   It is memory space where data gets stored. One database can have multiple collections.
- Collection:
   It is group of multiple documents. Table refers the collection in SQL.
- Document:
   It is a object (JSON) where data will be stored in mongodb. Rows/Records replicate this documents in SQL.
- Fields:
   It is a key in document data in mongodb database. Columns refer to fields in SQL.

Features:
1. Schema-less database:
     it doesn't follows any pre-defined structure to store data. so it's easy to manipulate individual documents.
2. High Scalability:
     In mongodb data will be shared across multiple servers so that horizontal scalling is easy when amount of data gets increased on any server.
3. Fast response:
     Query response is faster than sql database. because here no need to  join any tables to get final result.
4. Indexing:
     here we can create index on any field of one document so that searching  will be fast.
