Object class:
The Object class, found in the java.lang package, serves as the root of the class hierarchy in Java. Every class in Java implicitly or explicitly inherits from the Object class.
Inherited methods from object class:
- toString(): Returns a string representation of the object.
- equals(Object obj): Indicates whether some other object is "equal to" this one.
- hashCode(): Returns a hash code value for the object.
- getClass(): Returns the runtime class of this Object.
- clone(): Creates and returns a copy of this object.


Object cloning:
Object cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of an existing object. In Java, this is achieved using the clone() method, which is part of the Object class.
To enable object closing class should implement "Cloneable" interface and must override "clone()" method.
Shallow copy: It copies only primitive fields.
Deep copy: It copies all primitive and non primitive fields
