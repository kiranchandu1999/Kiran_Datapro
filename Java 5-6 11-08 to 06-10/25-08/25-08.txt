1. Inheritance
Inheritance in Java enables a class to inherit properties and actions from another class, called a superclass or parent class. A class derived from a superclass is called a subclass or child class.
we need to use extends keyword with child class to acquire properties from parent class.
Inheritance represents the IS-A relationship which is also known as a parent-child relationship.

types:
i. Single level inheritance
  -- from one parent to one child

ii. Multi level
  -- from grand parent to parent and then parent to child and so on.

iii. Hierarchical inheritance
   -- from one parent class to multiple child classes

iv. Multiple inheritance (not possible by classes in java)
   -- from multiple parents to single child

v. Hybrid inheritance
  -- hybrid inheritance is the composition of two or more types of inheritance.


Super keyword:
The super keyword in Java is a reference variable that is used to refer to immediate parent class objects.
Whenever you create the instance of a subclass, an instance of the parent class is created implicitly, which is referred to by the super reference variable.

- super can be used to refer to the immediate parent class instance variable and method.
- super() can be used to invoke the immediate parent class constructor.
