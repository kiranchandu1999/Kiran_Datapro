Arrays class:
It is a class which contains methods for different operations on array like searching, sorting, etc.

methods: (static)
- binarySearch(array, value) ----> it will search given value in that array
- sort(array) --> to sort the array
- fill(array, value) --> fill with given value
- copyOf(arr, length) --> copies array of given length


Math class:
It is a class which contains methods related to mathematical operations.

methods: (static)
- abs(number)  ---> it will return positive number as output
- min(num1, num2) ---> it will return minimum of both
- max(num1, num2)  ---> will return maximum of both params
- round(double)   ---> return after rounding it.
- pow(base, power)  --> return base to the power value
- random()  ---> it will generate 0 to 1 in decimal points.


Wrapper classes:
The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.
It is built based on primitive data types. so that these classes are oftenly used with collection api (stack, queue, etc).
byte ---->   Byte
short --->   Short
int     ---->   Integer
long   --->   Long
float    --->  Float
double  ----> Double
char    ---->   Character
boolean   ---->  Boolean

boxing:  converting primitive to wrapper class object
ex: Interger a1 = Integer.valueOf(10);

un-boxing: converting wrapper class object to primitive
ex: int a2 = a1.intValue();

note:
we can do boxing and unboxing automatically. those are called as
auto-boxing and auto un-boxing
