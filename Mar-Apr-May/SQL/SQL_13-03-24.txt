syntax -> INSERT INTO table_name (col_1, col_2, ....) values (val_1, val_2, ....);

R (read) => to read / get the data from db, use select command (DQL)
syntax -> SELECT * FROM table_name; (to get all columns data)
	SELECT col1_name, col_2,...... FROM table_name; (to get mentioned columns data)

U (update) => to update existing data in the db, use update command (DML)
syntax -> UPDATE table_name SET col_1 = val_1, col_2 = val_2 .... WHERE col_name (pk) = val;

D (delete) => to delete existing record/s from db, use delete command (DML)
syn => DELETE FROM table_name WHERE col_name = val;
