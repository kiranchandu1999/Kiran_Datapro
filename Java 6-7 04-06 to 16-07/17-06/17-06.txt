2. Polymorphism
Polymorphism means "many forms", and it occurs when we have many classes that are related to each other by inheritance.
- many methods with same name with different functionality.

Types:
i. Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
 - overloading methods with same name within the class.
 - we can achieve this polymorphism by following ways
   i. by passing different no of parameters
   ii. by passing different data type paramters

ii. Runtime polymorphism (Method overriding)
- writing the method which is present in parent class into child class with same method signature    then it is called method overriding, It's also called as Dynamic Method Dispatch, is a process in which a call to an overridden method is resolved at runtime rather than compile-time.

Note: Runtime polymorphism can't be achieved by data members.
