Loops:
Looping in programming languages is a feature that facilitates the execution of a set of instructions/functions repeatedly while some condition evaluates to true. Java provides three ways for executing the loops.

- for loop
The for loop is used when we know the number of iterations (we know how many times we want to repeat a task). The for statement consumes the initialization, condition, and increment/decrement.

syntax:
for(initialization; condition; increment/decrement) {
	// code to be executed
}


- while loop
while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
it is used when we doesn't know the no of iterations

syntax:
initialization
while(condition) {
      // code to be executed
      // updation
}


- do while loop
do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements.

syntax:
initialization
do {
     // code
     // updation
} while(condition);
