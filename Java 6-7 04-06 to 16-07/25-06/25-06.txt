Multi dimensional array:
when an array contains multiple arrays in it then it is called multi-dimensional array.

syntax for 2D:
data_type[ ][ ]  variable_name  =  new  data_type[ rows ][ cols ];
ex:  4, 5, 8, 6
        1, 3, 7, 2
         9, 4, 5, 1
int[ ][ ]  arr1  =  new int[3][4];

// data read and write
arr1[1][2] ---> 7


Arrays class:
It is a class which contains methods for different operations on array like searching, sorting, etc.

methods: (static)
- binarySearch(array, value) ----> it will search given value in that array
- sort(array) --> to sort the array
- fill(array, value) --> fill with given value
- copyOf(arr, length) --> copies array of given length


Math class:
It is a class which contains methods related to mathematical operations.

methods: (static)
- abs(number)  ---> it will return positive number as output
- min(num1, num2) ---> it will return minimum of both
- max(num1, num2)  ---> will return maximum of both params
- round(double)   ---> return after rounding it.
- pow(base, power)  --> return base to the power value
- random()  ---> it will generate 0 to 1 in decimal points.
