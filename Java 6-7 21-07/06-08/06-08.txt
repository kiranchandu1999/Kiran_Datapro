static keyword:
- using static keyword we can make variables and methods as static.
- if any variable or method is static it is related to class not object related.
- to call static variable or method use class name instead of object name.

static block:
Whenever we use a static keyword and associate it to a block, then that block is referred to as a static block. This code inside the static block is executed only once: the first time the class is loaded into memory. 
ex: static { // statements }

Instance block:
The initializer block contains the code that is always executed whenever an instance(object) is created.
ex: { // statements }
