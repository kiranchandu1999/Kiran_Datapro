Object cloning:
Object cloning is the process of creating an exact copy of an existing object. In Java, this is achieved using the clone() method, which is part of the Object class.
To enable object closing class should implement "Cloneable" interface and must override "clone()" method.
Shallow copy: It copies only primitive fields.
Deep copy: It copies all primitive and non primitive fields


Array:
It's a data structure which holds the data of similar type.
it follows 0th based indexing.
It is also an object and it stores elements in contiguous memory locations.
to read and write data into an array we need to use array_name[index].

Single Dimensional Array:
syntax:
data_type[ ]   variable_name  =  new    data_type[size];
  ex:----> int[ ]  arr1  =  new  int[10];

array initialization with values:
int[ ]   arr1   =  {5, 10, 12, 8, 4, 16};
arr1[3]  -----> 8


for each loop / enhanced for loop:
syntax:
for(data_type  variable_name : array/set) {
      // loop body
}
