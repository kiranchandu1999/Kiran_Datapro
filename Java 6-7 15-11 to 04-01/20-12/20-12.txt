Exception:
- An exception is an abnormal condition which terminates our program suddenly whenever it encounters any exception.
- it is a class in java which is present inside java.lang package.
- depending upon the condition JVM will throw the exception and terminates the program.
- Exception can be thrown by developer also.

Exception handling:
- If we handle the occured exceptions then we can prevent the abnormal termination of our program.
- these excpetion will be handled by using try and catch blocks.
- try block should contain the statements which might throw exception.
- catch block should contain the handling statements for that particular exception.

syntax:
try{

      // statements which might throw excpetion

}
catch(Exception e){
     // handling statements
}

note: we can't write catch block without try block
