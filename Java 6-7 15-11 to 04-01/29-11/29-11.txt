Loops:
it is group of statements which needs to be executed continuously.

- for loop
it is used when there is defined no of iterations to be executed

syntax:
for(initialization, condition, updation) {
	// statements
}


- while loop
while loop is a control flow statement that allows code to be executed repeatedly based on a given Boolean condition.
it is used when we doesn't know the no of iterations

syntax:
initialization
while(condition){
      // statements
      // updation
}


- do while loop
do while loop is similar to while loop with only difference that it checks for condition after executing the statements

syntax:
initialization
do{
     // statements
     // updation
} while(condition)
