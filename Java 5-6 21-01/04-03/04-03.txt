Comparable Interface:
The Comparable interface in Java is used to define the natural ordering of objects for a user-defined class. 
It is part of the java.lang package and it provides a compareTo() method to compare instances of the class. 
A class has to implement a Comparable interface to define its natural ordering.

Ex:
class Pair implements Comparable<Pair> {
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Pair o) {
        // Ascending order
        return this.v - o.v; 
    }
}

Comparator Interface:
Comparator interface in Java is used to order the objects of user-defined classes. 
A comparator object is capable of comparing two objects of the same class. Following function compare obj1 with obj2.

when to use:
when there is a requirement of multiple sorting orders, then we can use this comparator interface.

Ex:
class CustomSorting implements Comparator<Pair> {
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Pair p1, Pair p2) {
        // Ascending order
        return p1.v - p2.v; 
    }
}


Lambda expression:
Lambda Expressions were added in Java 8.
A lambda expression is a short block of code which takes in parameters and returns a value. 
Lambda expressions are similar to methods, but they do not need a name and they can be implemented right in the body of a method.

syntax:
(parameters...) -> { code block }
