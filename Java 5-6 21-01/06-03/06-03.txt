LinkedList:
Linked List is a part of the Collection framework present in java.util package. This class is an implementation of the LinkedList data structure which is a linear data structure where the elements are not stored in contiguous locations and every element is a separate object with a data part and address part. The elements are linked using pointers and addresses and each element is known as a node. 

syntax:
LinkedList<Generic> ll = new LinkedList<Generic>();
