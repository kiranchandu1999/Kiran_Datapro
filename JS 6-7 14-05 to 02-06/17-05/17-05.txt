Objects:
In real life, objects are things like: houses, cars, people, animals, or any other subjects.
Every object can have properties and methods
properties of car like name, brand, speed, model etc
methods are drive(), reverse(), stop() etc.

Objects are variables too. But objects can contain many values.
example:
const car = {name: "Innova", brand: "Toyota", color: "white", maxSpeed: 200};

Types to define objects:
Using an Object Literal
example:
const obj = {key: "value"};

Using the new Keyword
example:
const obj = new Object();

Access object values using keys:
example:
car.name  (or)  car["name"]
