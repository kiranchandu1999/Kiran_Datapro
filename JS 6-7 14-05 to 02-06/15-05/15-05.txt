Strings:
A JavaScript string is zero or more characters written inside quotes.

example:
let fruit = "Apple";  // using double quotes
let movie = 'Pushpa';  // using single quotes
let name = `Mahesh`;  // using template literal (back ticks)

let text = `He's often called "Johnny"`;  // comibination of all of them

Escape character:
let sentence = "India's national bird is \"Peacock\""

String methods:
Strings are primitive and immutable: All string methods produce a new string without altering the original string.

charAt(index): returns the character at given index
toUpperCase(): returns the string in capital letters
to LowerCase(): returns the string in small letters
concat(string): returns joined resultant string
trim(): returns final string after removing leading and lagging spaces
slice(start, end): returns some part of original string
padStart(length, char): returns padded string with given character
padEnd(length, char): returns padded string with given character
