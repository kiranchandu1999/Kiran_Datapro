2. Polymorphism
 - many methods with same name with different functionality.
 - we can achieve polymorphism by following ways
   i. by passing different no of parameters
   ii. by passing different data type paramters

types:
i. Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
  - overloading methods with same name within the class.

ii. Runtime polymorphism (Method overriding)
  - writing the method which is present in parent class into child class with same method signature then it is called method overriding



Abstraction:
abstraction is a mechanism which is used for data hiding.
it hides the method implementation details and it shows only definition.
implementation ways:
1. abstract class
2. interface

1. abstract class: (not 100% abstraction)
rules:
- a method implementation can be hidden by making method as abstract.
- if any abstract method presents in any class then that class also should be abstract.
- abstract methods implementation should be done in child class by method overrding.
- we can't create object for abstract classes.
- In abstract class we can have abstract and non abstract methods as well.
