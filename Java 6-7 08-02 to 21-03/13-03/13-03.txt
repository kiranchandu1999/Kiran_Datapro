Thread life cycle:
A thread can exist in different states at different point of time. it passes from one state to another state whenever we called method start.

States involved in thread life cycle:
1. New :
  -- this is a state when a new thread created and not yet started.

2. Ready to run :
  -- Thread is started using start method. in this state the thread is ready to      run but control is not given.

3. Running :
  -- Now thread is running in this state.

4. Sleep :
  -- Method sleep() is invoked and thread is sleeping for the given number of      milliseconds.

5. Blocked :
  -- Blocked by other threads for shared resources. it will wait until another     thread invokes notify() or notifyAll().

6. Dead :
   -- Thread got terminated.

Method inside Thread class:
1. currentThread()  --> returns reference to the currently working thread.
2. getName()  --> returns the thread's name
3. getPriority()  --> returns the thread's priority
4. isAlive()  --> tests if the thread is alive
5. run()  --> specifies the code to be executed
6. setName(string) --> changes the name of this thread
7. setPriority(int)  --> changes the priority
8. sleep(milli seconds)  ---> moves the current thread state to sleep and     stops execution till time gets over.
9. start()  --> creates a new thread and calls the run method of the thread.
