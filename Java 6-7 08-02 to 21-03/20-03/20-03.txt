Set Interface:
It is an unordered collection of objects in which duplicate values cannot be stored.
This is an interface and there are some concrete classes which implements this interface.

HashSet:
HashSet in Java implements the Set interface of Collections Framework. It is used to store the unique elements and it doesn’t maintain any specific order of elements.

syntax:
Set<Generic> set = new HashSet<>();


LinkedHashSet:
It combines the functionality of a HashSet with a LinkedList to maintain the insertion order of elements.

syntax:
Set<Generic> set = new LinkedHashSet<>();


TreeSet:
TreeSet is one of the most important implementations of the SortedSet interface in Java that uses a Tree(red – black tree) for storage. The ordering of the elements is maintained by a set using their natural ordering whether or not an explicit comparator is provided.

syntax:
Set<Generic> set = new TreeSet<>();

with comparator:
Set<Generic> set = new TreeSet<>(Comparator c);
