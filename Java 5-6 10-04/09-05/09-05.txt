Wrapper class:
The wrapper class in Java provides the mechanism to convert primitive into object and object into primitive.
It is built based on primitive data types. so that these classes are oftenly used with collection api (stack, queue, etc).
byte ---->   Byte
short --->   Short
int     ---->   Integer
long   --->   Long
float    --->  Float
double  ----> Double
char    ---->   Character
boolean   ---->  Boolean

boxing:  converting primitive to wrapper class object
ex: Interger a1 = Integer.valueOf(10);

un-boxing: converting wrapper class object to primitive
ex: int a2 = a1.intValue();

note:
we can do boxing and unboxing automatically. those are called as
auto-boxing and auto un-boxing


String:
It is a class in java which is used to store sequence of characters.
we can create strings in following ways:
1. using string literal
syntax:  String s1 = " ";
- these kind of string objects will be stored inside string constant pool which is present inside heap area.

2. using new keyword
syntax: String s2 = new String(" ");
- these kind of string objects will be stored in direct heap area not inside string constant pool.

methods:
1. charAt(index)   --->  to get character at given index.
2. length()     ---->  to get the string size;
3. startsWith(String)   ---> to check starting with given string
4. substring(from, to) -> returns substring
5. toLowerCase()
6. toUpperCase()
