Math class:
It is a class which contains methods related to mathematical operations.

methods: (static)
- abs(number)  ---> it will return positive number as output
- min(num1, num2) ---> it will return minimum of both
- max(num1, num2)  ---> will return maximum of both params
- round(double)   ---> return after rounding it.
- pow(base, power)  --> return base to the power value
- random()  ---> it will generate 0 to 1 in decimal points.


Arrays class:
It is a class which contains methods for different operations on array like searching, sorting, etc.

methods: (static)
- binarySearch(array, value) ----> it will search given value in that array
- sort(array) --> to sort the array
- fill(array, value) --> fill with given value
- copyOf(arr, length) --> copies array of given length

Functional interface:
If any interface having only one abstract method then it is called functional interface. it may have any number of default and static methods.

@Functional Interface
interface interface_name{
     // only one abstract method
     void run();

     // it can have default and static methods
     default void display(){
     }
}
