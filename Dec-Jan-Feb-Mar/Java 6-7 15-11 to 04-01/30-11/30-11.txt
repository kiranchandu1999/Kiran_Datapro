class:
it is a blueprint which contains properties and behaviours.
syntax:
class   class_name {
    // variables and methods
}

method:
it is a group of statements that needs to be executed to perform a task.
so by calling method we can get output as per our requirement

method_return_type  method_name(paramters) {
      // body
}


object:
it is a physical entity which is created from a particluar class.
syntax:
object_reference_type  object_name = new class_name();


Variables types:
1. Instance variables 
   - variables declared within the class
2. Local variables
   - variables declared within the method
3. Static variables
   - variables with static keyword


Constructor:
It is similar to method with no return type.
Name of the constructor should be same as class name
It will be called while creating objects of this class
By default JVM will create no paramters constructor for every class
If we create any constructor explicitly, JVM won't create default constructor


this keyword:
- it refers to the current object itself
- it is used to call current object variables and methods as well.
- this() is used to call the constructor of current object.
