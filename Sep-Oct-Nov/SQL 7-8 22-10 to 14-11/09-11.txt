Sub query:
It is also SQL query and used under a main query, sub queries can be implemented under SELECT, FROM and WHERE clauses.

- subquery with FROM clause:
  -- This query written after FROM clause
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, email FROM students;

SELECT full_name FROM (SELECT stu_id, full_name, email FROM students) As res1;


- subquery with WHERE clause:
  -- This query written after WHERE clause
Ex:
SELECT teach_id FROM teachers WHERE teach_salary <= 25000;  ---->  results teacher ids

SELECT * FROM students WHERE teacher_id IN (SELECT teach_id FROM teachers WHERE teach_salary <= 25000);  ---> results student details under above teacher ids


Subqueries Types:
Single row sub query
  -- query from which we get only one row as output
Multi row sub query
  -- query from which we get multiple rows as output
Multi column sub query
  -- query results data of multiple coulmns as output
Co-related sub query
  -- query written on same table on which main query is written

Ex:
SELECT e.name AS employee_name, m.name AS manager_name FROM employees e JOIN (SELECT id, name FROM employees) As m ON e.manager_id = m.id;


Set operators:
Union:
   -- it will merge and removes duplicates from both the tables
Ex:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE stu_id % 2 = 0
UNION
SELECT * FROM students WHERE stu_id % 2 != 0;

Union all:
   -- it will merge both the tables and shows result along with duplicates

Intersect:
   -- it will shows the common data from both tables
Ex:
SELECT * FROM students WHERE age = 22 OR stu_id % 2 = 0
INTERSECT
SELECT * FROM students WHERE stu_id % 2 = 0;

Minus:
   -- it will result difference data among the tables
   -- table_1 minus tabe_2 ------> extra data in table_1
   -- table_2 minus tabe_1 ------> extra data in table_2

Note: No of columns and order of columns from both query results should be same.
