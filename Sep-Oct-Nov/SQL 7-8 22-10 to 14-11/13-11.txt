Views:
view is a kind of virtual table.
syntax:
CREATE VIEW view_name AS select statement;

Ex:
GO
CREATE VIEW students_view_1 AS SELECT stu_id, full_name, email, teacher_id FROM students;

GO
CREATE VIEW stud_teach_view AS SELECT s.stu_id, s.full_name, s.email, t.teach_name FROM students s JOIN teachers t ON s.teacher_id = t.teach_id;

1.Normal views :
i. Simple view ---> depends on single base table
ii. Complex view ----> depends on multiple base tables using joins, group by etc.

2. Materialized view:
A view created from multiple tables in local DB and remote DB.

3. Inline view:
It is similar to sub queries. This view can be created by using select statement in FROM clause of another query.

note: we can do all DML operations on views in SQL.

syntax to delete view:
DROP VIEW view_name;

Ex:
DROP VIEW students_view_1;


Indexes:
Indexing is a mechanism through which we can create indexes to avail fast searching of data from tables;
By dafault admin will create indexes for columns which are having primary key and unique contraints.

Cradinality  ----> total no of distinct rows / total rows;
high cardinality --> 0.5 to 1
low cardinality --> 0 - 0.5

syntax:
CREATE INDEX index_name on table_name (col_name);

CREATE bitmap index index_name on table_name (col_name);

CREATE index index_name on table_name (fun(col_name));

Ex:
CREATE INDEX stu_id_idx ON students(stu_id);

Index types:
1. B-Tree index (Balance tree index) - default
     -- Hight cardinality
2. Bitmap index
     -- Low cardinality
3. Function based index

Logical types in index:
i. unique or non unique index
ii. Composite index  (creating index for multiple columns combinely)

DROP INDEX table_name.index_name;

Ex:
DROP INDEX students.stu_id_idx;
