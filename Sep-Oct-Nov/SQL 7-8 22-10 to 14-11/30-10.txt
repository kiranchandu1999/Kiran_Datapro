-- Updating records using where clause
By using where clause we can update only selected records instead of updating all records unnecessarly. 

UPDATE table_name SET col1 = val1, col2 = val2,....
WHERE existing_col_name = existing_col_val;

Ex:
UPDATE students SET email = 'krishna@gmail.com' WHERE stu_id = 106;


-- Deleting existing records from existing table in a particular database
By using this command we can delete a single or multiple records/rows from the existing table.

DELETE FROM table_name; (without where clause)

Note: If we ignore where condition, it will delete all the records

DELETE FROM table_name WHERE col_name = col_value;

Ex:
DELETE FROM students WHERE stu_id = 102;

Note: These DML commands can be rollbacked to the previous state, but DDL commands cannot be rollbacked.
      To rollback any DML query before executing that query need to specify BEGIN TRANSACTION, then only we can rollback.

Ex:
BEGIN TRANSACTION
DELETE FROM students WHERE stu_id = 102;

ROLLBACK TRANSACTION;


-- DQL (Data Query Language)
This language contains only one command called 'SELECT', it is used to fetch the data from existing tables.

syntax:
SELECT  col1_name, col2_name, col3_name,...  FROM  table_name;

Note: To fetch all columns data then need to use "*" instead of specific column names. to get only specific records/rows then need to use where clause.

Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, email FROM students;
(or)
SELECT stu_id, full_name, email FROM students WHERE stu_id = 106;
