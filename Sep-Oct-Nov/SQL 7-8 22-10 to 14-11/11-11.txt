String functions:
- upper(string) ---> converts into uppercase
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, UPPER(full_name) AS fullName FROM students;

- lower(string) ----> converts into lower case
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, LOWER(full_name) AS fullName FROM students;

- length(string)  ----> length of string
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, LEN(full_name) AS name_length FROM students;

- reverse(string) ----> it reverses the original string
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, REVERSE(full_name) AS reverse_name FROM students;

- substring(string, from_pos, substring-length)  ----> it returns given length of substring starting from given pos
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, SUBSTRING(full_name, 1, 3) AS extrcated_name FROM students;

note:----> if from_pos is positive then it starts from starting and if it's negative starts from ending

- ltrim() / rtrim(string, content)  -------> if content is there it removes content either left or right, else removes space
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, RTRIM(full_name, 'a') AS extrcated_name FROM students;

- replace(string, old_string, new_string) ---> replace old with new string
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, REPLACE(full_name, 'a', 'e') AS replaced_name FROM students;

- CHARINDEX(search_string, string, from_pos) 
Ex:
SELECT stu_id, full_name, CHARINDEX('a', full_name) AS position FROM students;


- SQL Case operator
CASE
    WHEN condition1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition2 THEN result2
    WHEN conditionN THEN resultN
    ELSE result
END;

SELECT stu_id, full_name, 
CASE 
WHEN CHARINDEX(' ', full_name) != 0 THEN SUBSTRING(full_name, 1, CHARINDEX(' ', full_name)-1) 
ELSE full_name 
END AS first_name 
FROM students;
