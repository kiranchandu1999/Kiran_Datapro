-- DISTINCT - It is used to get the unique column values from a table. we can apply distinct on single column not multiple.

Ex:
SELECT DISTINCT city from students;


-- GROUP BY - It is used to group the records based on particular column value. can apply group by on single or multiple columns
	   But we can select only those columns on which the group by is applied, it is mainly used to do aggregate functions.

SELECT col_x FROM table_name GROUP BY col_x;

Ex:
SELECT city FROM students GROUP BY city; (on single column)
SELECT city, age FROM students GROUP BY city, age; (on multiple columns)


-- HAVING - It is used to filter the fetched records based on some particular condition. It is similar to WHERE clause, 
	    but it is used only with GROUP BY clause.


-- ORDER BY - It is used to sort the records based on particular column value either ascending or descending.
	     we can apply order by on single or multiple columns, if first column value matches then it orders according to 2nd column value.

SELECT col1, col2, ...  FROM table_name  ORDER BY  col_name;

Ex:
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY city; (on single column)
SELECT * FROM students ORDER BY city, full_name;  (on multiple columns)
