-- renaming the existing table
ALTER TABLE table_name
RENAME TO new_name

SQL server:
EXEC sp_rename 'old_table_name', 'new_table_name';

Ex:
EXEC sp_rename 'students', 'students_table';


-- drop the existing table
DROP TABLE table_name;

Ex:
DROP TABLE students;

-- to drop the existing database
DROP DATABASE database_name

Ex:
DROP DATABASE college_db;


-- truncating the existing table
TRUNCATE TABLE table_name

Ex:
TRUNCATE TABLE students;


--- DROP VS TRUNCATE:
DROP:
- It deletes table structure and its containing data
- It clears the table space complications from memory
- It is slow as there are so many complications compared to the TRUNCATE command.

TUNCATE:
- It deletes all the data and preserves the structure of the table
- This query does not free the table space from memory
- It is fast as compared to the DROP command as there are fewer complications.


---- Constraints in SQL:
- SQL constraints are used to specify some rules for the data in a table.
- Constraints are used to limit the type of data that can got into the table. this ensures the accuracy and reliability of the data in the table.
- Constraints can be column level or table level.
The following are the constraints used in SQL:

1. NOT NULL - Ensures that column cannot have a null value

Ex:
full_name  varchar(20)  NOT NULL  (or)  full_name  varchar(20) CONSTRAINT constraint_name  NOT NULL

2. UNIQUE - It ensures that all values in a column should be unique

Ex:
email_id  varchar(15)  UNIQUE  (or)  email_id  varchar(15)  CONSTRAINT constraint_name  UNIQUE

3. PRIMARY KEY - It is combination of NOT NULL and UNIQUE. It is useful to identify the particular record/row in a table. 
		 One table can have only one primary key column

Ex:
stu_id  int  PRIMARY KEY  (or)   stu_id  int  CONSTRAINT constraint_name  PRIMARY KEY

4. FOREIGN KEY - It is a primary key in child table and it acts as a foreign key in parent table. 
		 so this contraint is useful for establishing the connection between multiple tables.

Ex:
dept_id  int  FOREIGN KEY  REFERENCES  reference_table (ref_column)  (or) dept_id  int CONSTRAINT constraint_name FOREIGN KEY  REFERENCES  reference_table

5. CHECK - Ensures that the values in a column satisfies a specific condition.

Ex:
student_age  int  CHECK (student_age > 18)

6. DEFAULT - Sets a default value for a column if no value is specified

Ex:
stu_mobile  char(10)  DEFAULT '12345'
