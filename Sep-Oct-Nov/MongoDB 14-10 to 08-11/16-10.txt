Create Read Update Delete (CRUD):
Create:--->
1. Creating database:
we have some default dbs already exists in our mongodb server.
- show dbs
   --> to know the existing dbs which contains data in it.
- db
   --> it will show the current working db.
- use database_name
   --> it will switch to that db if it is exists or else it will create new db and switched to it.

2. creating collections:
we can create collection by following 2 ways
- db.createCollection("collection_name")
   --> creates new collection in working db.

- db.collection_name.insertOne/Many() 
   --> it creates new collection if not exists and then adds the data to it.

- show collections
  --> it will give all existing collections inside working db.

3. Inserting documents into collections:
 we can insert data in the form of documents to our collection.
- db.collection_name.insertOne(object)
   ---> it will insert only one document at a time.

- db.collection_name.insertMany(object[ ])
   ---> it will add multiple objects at a time.

Read:--->
4. Reading documents / data from collection:
- db.collection_name.find():
  --> to get all documents inside given collection.

- db.collection_name.findOne():
   ---> to get only first document from given collection.

- db.collection_name.find(object) or findOne(object) 
   ---> to get filtered data from collection.

- db.collection_name.find(filtering_object, projection object)
  ---> to get selected fields inside project object.
  projection object: { filed_1: 1, field_2 : 1, _id : 0, ...}
  put 1 as value for fields you want to diplay
  put 0 as value for fields dont want to display
note: cannot use 1 and 0 in same projection object except _id field.
