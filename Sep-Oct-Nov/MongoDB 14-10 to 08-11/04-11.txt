Indexes in mongodb:
- Index is used for fast data retrieving. by default mongodb creates index and inserts as a field with name of "_id" and index name for this will be "_id_".
- we can create multiple indexes for every collection.
- but we should create indexes for fields which are mostly used for data searching operations.
- indexes should be created for fields which are more likely unique or rare compare to other fields.

To show the existing indexs:
syntax:
  db.collection.getIndexes();

To create a new index for any field in a collection:
syntax:
   db.collection.createIndex({fieldName: 1 or -1})

note:
   if specify 1 then indexes will be stored in ascending order else will stored in descending order.

we can find the execution statistics with the following query:
db.students.find({city: "kakinada"}).explain("executionStats")

To drop any existing index:
syntax:
  db.collection.dropIndex("index_name")


To drop collection from database:
syntax:
   db.collection.drop();

To drop database:
syntax:
    db.dropDatabase();



mongoimport --db dummyDB --collection fruits --file sample1.json

mongoexport --db collegeDB --collection students --out students1.json
