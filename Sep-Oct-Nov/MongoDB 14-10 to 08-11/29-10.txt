Ordered and unordered insertion of data:
- basically inserting of documents by default follows insertion order.
- by default ordered key is true, so that while inserting multiple documents if any error occured then it stops insertion into db.
- so if we make ordered key value as false then it will ignores those error documents and inserts remaining ones.

syntax: db.collection.insertMany([{}, {}], {ordered: false});


Elements operators:
These operators are used to display data according to field properties like field existnace, field value size etc.
1. exists:
     - it is used to display data based particluar field existence.
     - it takes true or false, if we pass true in the query it will show data which is having that field vice versa.
ex: db.students.find({college: {$exists: false}, ph: {$exists: true}});

2. type:
    - it is used to display data based on filed type like string, number etc.
    - it takes field type as a value for $type key.
ex: db.students.find({ph: {$type: 'string'}});

3. size:
    - it is used to display the data based on array size of a particular field.
ex: db.students.find({comments: {$size: 4});


Complex expressions:
$expr:
  this operator is used to define complex expressions and based on that exapression we will get data as output.

syntax:
  db.collection.find({$expr: {operator: [filed, value]}})
ex: 
   db.students.find({$expr: {$gt: ['$age', 21]}})
without $expr:
    db.students.find({age: {$gt: 21}})
real use case:
     db.students.find({$expr: {$gt: [ '$age', {$multiply: [4, 5]}]}})

Embedded documents:
if any document having a field with value as an array or an object then it's called embedded document. 
to access embedded documents need to use dot notation.
syntax: db.collection.find('parent.child': value)
