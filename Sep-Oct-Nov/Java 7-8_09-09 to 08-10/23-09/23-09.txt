4. Encapsulation
- It is a process of encapsulating all variables and methods which are inter related within a block. and we call it as class.
- we can restrict data accessibility for other classes and methods.

Access modifiers:
1. private  ----> accessible within the class
2. default   -----> accessible within the package
3. protected  ----> accessible within the package and subclasses of other packages
4. public  -----> accessible everywhere
