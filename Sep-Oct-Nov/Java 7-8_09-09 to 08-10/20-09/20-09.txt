OOPs - Object Oriented Programming
Class:
It is a blueprint which can have variables and methods.
synatx:
class  class_name {
    // variables
    // methods
}

method:
It is group of statements which will take some input and process it then it will give output accordingly.
when we call method it will start execution.
syntax:
method_return_type   method_name (parameters if any) {
    // method body
}

Object:
It is a physical entity which is created based on particular class.
syntax:
Object_ref_type  object_name = new class_name();

Variables types:
1. Instance variables 
   - variables declared within the class
2. Local variables
   - variables declared within the method
3. Static variables
   - variables with static keyword

Constructor:
It is similar to method with no return type.
Name of the constructor should be same as class name
It will be called while creating objects of this class
By default JVM will create no paramters constructor for every class
If we create any constructor explicitly, JVM won't create default constructor

this keyword:
- it refers to the current object itself
- it is used to call current object variables and methods as well.
- this() is used to call the constructor of current object.

static keyword:
- using static keyword we can make variables, methods as static.
- if any variable or method is static it is related to class not object related.
- to call static variable or method use class name instead of object name.
