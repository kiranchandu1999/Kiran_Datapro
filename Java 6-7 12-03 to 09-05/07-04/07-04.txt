Constructor:
A constructor in Java is a special method that is used to initialize objects. The constructor is called when an object of a class is created. It can be used to set initial values for object attributes
Note:
It is similar to method with no return type.
Name of the constructor should be same as class name
It will be called while creating objects of this class
By default JVM will create no paramters constructor for every class
If we create any constructor explicitly, JVM won't create default constructor


this keyword:
- it refers to the current object itself
- it is used to call current object variables and methods as well.
- this() is used to call the constructor of current object.


static keyword:
- using static keyword we can make variables, methods as static.
- if any variable or method is static it is related to class not object related.
- to call static variable or method use class name instead of object name.


Variables types:
1. Instance variables 
   - variables declared within the class
2. Local variables
   - variables declared within the method
3. Static variables
   - variables with static keyword
