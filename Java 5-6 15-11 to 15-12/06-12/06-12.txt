2. Polymorphism
 - many methods with same name with different functionality.
 - we can achieve polymorphism by following ways
   i. by passing different no of parameters
   ii. by passing different data type paramters

types:
i. Compile-time polymorphism (Method overloading)
  - overloading methods with same name within the class.

ii. Runtime polymorphism (Method overriding)
  - writing the method which is present in parent class into child class with same method signature then it is called method overriding
