Functions:
A JavaScript function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task.
this function gets executed when we call it.

syntax:
function   fun_name (parameter 1, param 2, param 3) {
	// function body
}

Funtion can be defined to return a computed value by using "return" keyword, whenever return statement gets
reached that function will return value to the place where the function was called.

Function expression:
A function expression in JavaScript defines a function within an expression. It can be either named or anonymous. Unlike function declarations, function expressions are not hoisted, meaning they must be defined before they can be called.

example:
let variable = function() { // body };

Arrow function:
Arrow functions, introduced in ES6, provide a concise syntax for writing function expressions in JavaScript. They are also known as lambda functions in some other programming languages.

example:
let subtract = (num1, num2) => {
    return num1 - num2;
}
