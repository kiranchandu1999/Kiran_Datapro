Array:
It's a data structure which holds the data of similar type.
it follows 0th based indexing.
It is also an object and it stores elements in contiguous memory locations.
to read and write data into an array we need to use array_name[index].

There are two types of array
* Single Dimensional Array
* Multidimensional Array


Single Dimensional Array:
syntax:
data_type[ ]   variable_name  =  new    data_type[size];
  ex:----> int[ ]  arr1  =  new  int[10];

array initialization with values:
int[ ]   arr1   =  {5, 10, 12, 8, 4, 16};
arr1[3]  -----> 8


for each loop / enhanced for loop:
syntax:
for(data_type  variable_name : array/set) {
      // loop body
}
